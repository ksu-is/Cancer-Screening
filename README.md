# Cancer-Screening
Software that will determine your overall risk for cancer based on lifestyle and family history. Not all cancers are hereditary however, understanding your risk od hereditary cancers can give you an idea of warning signs to look out for in the future and can lead to a better chance of survival. 
This software is not intended to be a diagnostic tool and should not be used in place of a doctor. This is intended only to show if you are at a high risk or not.
